# fusing-segmentation-models
This repository represents some approaches of fusing two identical segmentation models. They are both convolutional neural network based, inspired from a cross-fusion model. One represents the neural network architecture that is trained with camera images, and the same one is used to learns features from dense map Lidar data.
